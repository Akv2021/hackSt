UPDATED: An update on efforts to reduce spam with Hacktoberfest: introducing maintainer opt-in and more.
Posted at 2020/10/03 02:30 UTC

Updated (2020/10/05 15:00 UTC): Individual pull requests can also be directly opted-in to Hacktoberfest with the ‘hacktoberfest-accepted’ label, on any public GitHub repository, without the need for the ‘hacktoberfest’ repository topic.

Thank you to everyone who has reached out with ideas and suggestions to help Hacktoberfest live its values of celebrating and fostering the open source community.

After working closely with our friends at GitHub, we are happy to introduce a new measure to help significantly reduce the amount of spammy contribution. We’re making Hacktoberfest opt-in only for projects – which maintainers can do simply by adding the ‘hacktoberfest’ topic to a repository.

This was one of the primary requests from maintainers and we are hopeful that it will help alleviate some of the issues you've been facing.

We will honor all valid pull requests prior to this change, and as of October 3, 2020 at 12:00:00 UTC – and October 3 in all time zones – pull requests will only count toward earning a T-shirt or planting a tree if they are labeled as ‘hacktoberfest-accepted’ by a maintainer, or submitted in a repository classified with the ‘hacktoberfest’ topic. Pull requests in repositories with the ‘hacktoberfest’ topic will also need to be merged, approved by a maintainer, or labeled as ‘hacktoberfest-accepted’ in order to qualify. The deadline for completions, merging, labeling, and approving is November 1.

To put the rules in a form consistent with the spirit of Hacktoberfest:

PRs count if:
Submitted during the month of October AND
Submitted in a public repo AND (
  The PR is labelled as hacktoberfest-accepted by a maintainer OR
  Submitted in a repo with the hacktoberfest topic AND (
    The PR is merged OR
    The PR has been approved
  )
)
